# Object-Detection
Implementation of different Object Detection Algorithms 
Object detection is a computer technology-related computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos[7]. There are two terms that are used quite interchangeably when it comes to standard computer vision problems, object localization, and object detection[11]. Predicting the class of a single object in a picture is known as image classification. The process of locating one or more items in an image and tracing a bounding box around their extent is known as object localization. These two tasks are combined in object detection, which locates and categorizes one or more things in an image.

Object localization is also known as simultaneous classification and localization where the goal of the model is to output what the object is and where it is whereas the only difference in object detection is that it handles the combinatorial nature of the world[11].
Object Detection = Image classification + Object localization.

There have been many popular approaches for detecting objects. Amongst them, the popular ones which I am implementing are the Region proposal approach and regression approach. The region proposal network is essentially a convolutional implementation of the sliding windows approach[5]. Detection systems following the sliding window approach repurpose classifier which runs at evenly spaced locations over the entire image to perform detection. It is evaluated at different locations and scales in a test image.  In simpler words take windows of different sizes, slide them over the image, and have the neural network classify whether there is an object or not[8]. This approach isnâ€™t very efficient since we will end up having the network produce thousands of classifications on every single image.
To speed up the process of finding areas of the image that potentially contain objects of interest, the computer vision research community has come up with a set of region proposal algorithms. Machine learning models which follow such algorithms are popularly known as R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Network). It is the method to first generate the potential bounding boxes in an image and then run a classifier on these proposed boxes[6]. After classification, post-processing is used to refine the bounding boxes, eliminate duplicate detection, and rescore the boxes based on the other objects in the scene. 
This Popular approach in the consideration is where we reframe the object detection as a single regression problem, straight from image pixel to bounding box coordinates and class probabilities, breaking new ground by using a single fully connected layer to predict the locations of objects in an image, essentially requiring only a single iteration to find the objects of interest[1][2]. This results in a massive acceleration at inference time compared to other approaches. 
With these different approaches come the different architectures to implement object detection. The upcoming sections will explore such models and architectures in detail.
