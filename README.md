# Object-Detection
Implementation of different Object Detection Algorithms 
Object detection is a computer technology-related computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos. There are two terms that are used quite interchangeably when it comes to standard computer vision problems, object localization, and object detection. Predicting the class of a single object in a picture is known as image classification. The process of locating one or more items in an image and tracing a bounding box around their extent is known as object localization. These two tasks are combined in object detection, which locates and categorizes one or more things in an image.

Object localization is also known as simultaneous classification and localization where the goal of the model is to output what the object is and where it is whereas the only difference in object detection is that it handles the combinatorial nature of the world.
Object Detection = Image classification + Object localization.

There have been many popular approaches for detecting objects. Amongst them, the popular ones which I am implementing are the Region proposal approach and regression approach.
