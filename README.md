# Object-Detection
Implementation of different Object Detection Algorithms 
Object detection is a computer technology-related computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos. There are two terms that are used quite interchangeably when it comes to standard computer vision problems, object localization, and object detection. Predicting the class of a single object in a picture is known as image classification. The process of locating one or more items in an image and tracing a bounding box around their extent is known as object localization. These two tasks are combined in object detection, which locates and categorizes one or more things in an image.

Object localization is also known as simultaneous classification and localization where the goal of the model is to output what the object is and where it is whereas the only difference in object detection is that it handles the combinatorial nature of the world.
Object Detection = Image classification + Object localization.

There have been many popular approaches for detecting objects. Amongst them, the popular ones which I am implementing are the Region proposal approach and regression approach. 
# Regression-Based Model: YOLO
YOLO is a state-of-the-art, object detection algorithm. YOLO is an abbreviation for the term ‘You Only Look Once’ Joseph Redmon was the one who created it. The speed without much precision comprises is the major benefit over other designs. In comparison to R-CNN and other models, the YOLO family models learn relatively generic representations of the object quickly. By interpreting object detection as a single regression problem that spatially separates bounding boxes and associated class probabilities, YOLO avoids the need for complicated pipelines. YOLO directly optimizes detection performance while training on complete photos. It offers a single neural network that, in a single assessment, predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities from the entire image.
#	Region proposal Model: Faster RCNN
A team of researchers at Microsoft Faster 2015 created Faster RCNN the advanced version of R-CNN and Fast R-CNN which become the state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. RCNN stands for “Region proposal” combined with “Convolutional Neural Networks”. This is used to hypothesize object location in the regions proposed within the image. The region proposal algorithm seeks to replace the sliding window approach where the different regions are extracted from the image. These regions are then generally passed through the high-performance CNN to determine potential objects and their locations in the image. The RCNN Family model for object detection applies a convolutional neural network to further process extracted region to localize and segments objects. The version before Faster RCNN proposes approximately two thousand regions using a selective search technique per image which makes it slow enough when applied to large datasets. The computational bottleneck of the cutting-edge detection systems is observed to be region proposal techniques, which are observed to take as long as the detection network. As a result, the improved version known as Faster RCNN is created by removing the various phases involved in the prior procedure.
